# Sound Tile (TypeScript)
An app that lets you visualize music (or other sounds) in tiles.

Like [corrscope](https://github.com/corrscope/corrscope) but different.

Sound Tile is a highly-customizable real-time music visualization app that runs in the browser. It aims to provide flexible layout possibilities for any music visualization need in real time (NO pre-processing!!), featuring spectrum analyzers, waveform correlation (like corrscope), and spectrograms.

Officially hosted online at [sound-tile.web.app](https://sound-tile.web.app) with development builds at [sound-tile-dev.web.app](https://sound-tile-dev.web.app).

There will be a better showcase and tutorial of features in the future, but for now, check out the sites and experiment!
